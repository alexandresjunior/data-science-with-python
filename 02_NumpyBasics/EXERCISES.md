# Section #2 - Exercises

1. **BMI (Body Mass Index)** is an indicator used to detect situations of obesity or malnutrition. To obtain the BMI, simply calculate the ratio between an individual's **weight** (kg) and their **height** (m) squared. Write a function to calculate BMI using Numpy arrays as inputs.
2. Write another function to calculate BMI but now using *lists* and compare its perfomance to the previous one.
3. Consider the following array:
    ```
    data = np.array(
         [
             ['Robert', 'married', 'male'],
             ['Sheila', 'single', 'female'],
             ['Bruno', 'single', 'male'],
             ['Rita', 'married', 'female']
         ]
    )
    ```
    Write a code snippet which allows the selection, **without the use of logical operators** (`and` and `or`), of **name** and **marital status** information, only for **males**.
4. Given the `ages` array:
    ```
    ages = np.array([10, 23, 45, 34, 25])
    ```
    Write a code snippet to get the **arithmetic mean** of the ages.
